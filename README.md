# Virtual-Private-Cloud-VPC-

## Overview
This guide walks through the setup of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), including public subnet configuration, Internet Gateway, route tables, security groups, and launching EC2 instances—providing the foundation for AWS network architecture.
 
## Architecture Diagram

 
## Key Steps Covered
1.	Create VPC
   	Define a CIDR block (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16) to isolate your network.
2.	Add Public Subnet
  	Allocate a subnet (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24) for resources that require internet access.
3.	Internet Gateway (IGW)
o	Attach IGW to the VPC to facilitate outbound and inbound internet traffic.
4.	Route Table Setup
o	Route all outbound traffic (0.0.0.0/0) from the public subnet through the IGW.
5.	Launch EC2 Instance
o	Deploy an instance in the public subnet, ensuring it receives a public IP for access.
6.	Configure Security Group
o	Permit SSH (port 22) and HTTP (port 80) inbound access; typically allow all outbound traffic.
7.	Verification
o	SSH into the EC2 instance or access via HTTP to confirm connectivity.
 
## Why It Matters
### Feature	Benefit
Network segmentation	Keeps application architecture secure and isolated
Controlled access rules	Limits exposure to only necessary ports
Public subnet setup	Enables external access while keeping private data safe
Resilient routing	Ensures service remains accessible over internet
 
## Summary of Best Practices
•	Always tag your VPCs and subnets for easier management and billing.
•	Use public subnets for internet-facing components (with proper security groups).
•	Leverage private subnets with NAT Gateway for internal workloads requiring outbound access.
•	Use strict security group rules—avoid overly broad access permissions.
•	Maintain a clean separation of route tables for public versus private traffic.
 
## Suggested Next Moves
•	Extend the architecture to include private subnets with NAT Gateways for backend services.
•	Add Bastion hosts for secure SSH access to private instances.
•	Implement auto-scaling groups for high availability of front-end instances.
•	Integrate CloudWatch alarms, ELBs, and health checks for resilient operations.
